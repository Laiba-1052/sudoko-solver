# Sudoku Solver in C++

I have developed a Console-Based Sudoku Puzzle Solver and Player using C++.


## Tools used

VSCode

## Features

Console Interface with neatly centered UI
Automatic Solver using backtracking and heuristics
Real-time Input Validation
Error Handling for Invalid Moves
Victory & Failure Messages
Option to Reveal the Solution
## How it works

The game uses a priority queue to optimize the solving process by choosing the cell with the least number of possibilities first.

The backtracking algorithm is enhanced with possibility count heuristics for better performance.

The board is dynamically printed with center alignment to create a more polished console experience.
## Dependencies

Standard C++ libraries: iostream, iomanip, string
